# What is a Battleship Game?
Well, every game freak person knows about this. There are some enemy ships in the sea, they are hidden. You have to guess the point and hit there. If your guess is right, you'll destroy the enemy ships and be the winner. Otherwise, thumbs down for you!

# What about this battleship?
Well, this is just a console based battleship which is written in Pyhton within only 60+ lines of codes. Nothing special, nothing stylish. Just practicing my logics on Pyhton. After executing you'll find a 5x5 matrix full of 'O'! You have to input your guessed row and column as the co-ordinate place of the sea. If your guessed input is right you will be given by a winning message! other wise you have to go for next guess. In that case, next matrix will show you an 'X' instead of 'O' in that position where you've last hit. You have only 4 turns to guess! So, let's try your fortune! :)

# So you can download this project, test it by execution, may add bunch of codes to develop it further more!
