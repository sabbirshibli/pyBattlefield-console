# What is a Battleship Game?
Well, every game freak person know about this. There are some enemy ships in the sea, they are hidden. You have to guess the point and hit there. If your guess is right, you'll destroy the enemy ship and be the winner. Otherwise, thumbs down for you!

# What about this battleship?
Well, this is just a console based battleship which is written in Pyhton within only 60+ lines of codes. Nothing special, nothing stylish. Just practicing my logics on Pyhton

# So you can download this project, test it by execution, may add bunch of code to develop it further more!
